<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<span class="direction">Room
in <span class="character">Lattin’s</span> London house. <span class="character">Mrs.
Lattin</span> lies on sofa. A picture of Ancient
Egypt, showing the Nile, palms and temples
on wall easily visible to her.</span></p>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<span class="direction">Present day, evening.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>What time is it, nurse&mdash;<em>now</em>?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>Close on half-past five.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">With irritability of a sick woman.</span>) Not
later? Are you sure? It’s so dark.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Soothingly.</span>) The dusk is closing in;
I’ll light your lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Half-past five, you said? My husband
expected to be back before this. Hasn’t
he come? The appointment was for half-past
two.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>The Foreign Office takes its time. Mr.
Lattin will come to you the moment he gets
in.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>You’re sure? I thought I heard his step.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>I’ll go and see the moment the lamp is
lit. But he never forgets. He always comes
in here first.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>But he’s so long to-day, longer than usual.
And he looked so grave, nurse, when he left.
He looked worried, I thought. You noticed
it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>He <em>is</em> taken up with these politics just
now. It’s only natural, considering the
crisis in Egypt. But he’s always so in
earnest, isn’t he? I noticed nothing unusual.
The Government is lucky to have him
at such a time. No one could fill <em>his</em> place.
(<span class="direction">Brings lamp.</span>) There’s the lamp. Is the
shading right?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Fill his place! No, indeed. Phillip
understands the natives better than anybody
in the world. And the country too (<span class="direction">wistfully</span>).
If only I could bring myself to go
back to Egypt with him. (<span class="direction">Irritably.</span>) The
light catches my eye there. To the left
a little. Now to the right. Thank you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>The doctors all agree it’s best not, don’t
they? The dry climate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>It’s not that, nurse. Dryness is what I
<em>need</em>&mdash;warmth and dryness. It’s something
else. Egypt frightens me. I can’t
sleep there. Dreams come to me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>The doctors said it was the effect of the
climate on the nerves.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Oh, I know. I’d face it if I could&mdash;another
winter. It means so much to Mr.
Lattin, doesn’t it? Nurse! It’s curious&mdash;it’s
strange, don’t you think&mdash;that Mr. Lattin
feels nothing of that <em>I</em> feel there? I
mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>Hark! I think that’s Mr. Lattin’s step.
I’ll go and see.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>It can’t be the new doctor, can it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>Dr. Ogilvie? Not yet. Six o’clock he was
to come. He won’t be here before his time.
These great specialists are busy men.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Wearily.</span>) I’ve seen so many doctors.
I hardly feel as if I had the strength for a
new examination. Dr. Ogilvie will do me no
good.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>Still you will see him. For your husband’s
sake.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Ah, yes, for Phillip’s sake. I think my
husband’s coming, nurse.</p>

<p class="direction-c">(<span class="direction">Enter <span class="character">Phillip</span>.</span>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Nurse</span></p>

<p>Good-evening, Mr. Lattin. Mrs. Lattin
is a trifle better. I’ll leave you for a little,
but she must not tire herself. We are expecting
Dr. Ogilvie at six.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>I’ll be very careful.</p>

<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction"><span class="character">Nurse</span> exit.</span></p>

<p class="direction-c">(<span class="direction"><span class="character">Phillip</span> comes to his wife.</span>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>At last, Phillip. I’m so glad you’ve come,
dear. I’ve been waiting and longing so.
They kept you&mdash;but you belong to me, don’t
you? You’re tired, poor old thing. Come to
me, Phillip&mdash;closer. (<span class="direction">Stretches out hand.</span>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>I <em>am</em> a bit late. I’m sorry, Little Child.
They kept me, yes. But <em>you</em>&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>I’m well enough to listen. You’re back;
I forgive you. And it’s all arranged as you
wished&mdash;as you hoped?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Sir George was kindness itself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>You saw the Foreign Secretary!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>You didn’t know I was such a big-wig,
did you? It is important, you see, dear.
The situation out there is complicated. I’ve
left them in the lurch a little, and my advice&mdash;er&mdash;my
knowledge, Sir George was
good enough to say&mdash;at such a time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>In the lurch, Phillip! How in the lurch?
You’re only asking a longer leave than
usual.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>There, there. I don’t want you to worry
your dear head with politics. The new doctor
will be here any minute now. That’s far
more important.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>I would rather know exactly. It doesn’t
worry me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>It’s all been arranged most satisfactorily,
dear; and I’m very pleased. So <em>you’re</em>
pleased with me&mdash;eh?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Phillip&mdash;what has been arranged?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Sir George was most complimentary. The
Government would recognise my services&mdash;my
long services, he called it. He even discussed
with me&mdash;asked my advice, if you
<em>must</em> know the full weight of honour placed
upon me!&mdash;as to my successor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Successor!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>But, darling, <em>some one</em> must fill my place.
There must be a <i lang="la">locum tenens</i>, as they say in
the church.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>You’ve&mdash;resigned!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Dear one, there was no other way. It’s
a formality, you see. I can always take it
up again where I left it off. Our man in
Egypt&mdash;just now&mdash;must be <em>there</em>. He must
be on the spot, of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>But six months’ leave! Surely, six
months’ leave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Means the entire winter. There, there,
Little Child, it’s nothing. You must not
exaggerate like this. What is my work in
Egypt compared to being with you. The
doctors forbid you to go out. It’s quite
simple: I prefer to stay with you. <em>My</em>
world lies in your heart. I&mdash;I can always
take up the work again when&mdash;when you’re
better.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Resigned, resigned! You have actually
resigned. Your career&mdash;I have broken your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
career&mdash;at last&mdash;completely. Is it wrong,
then, that I need you so?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Hush, dearest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>You have paid this tremendous price&mdash;and
I have made you pay it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>I wish to be always with you. That is
my only wish, my only happiness.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>For my sake you have sacrificed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>It’s I who am selfish to tire you with all
this stupid Government business. There,
now; you’ve talked too much and I have
done you harm. There’s only happiness in
my heart. No more nonsense-talk about sacrifice.
You must lie quiet and rest again.
I can be always with you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Yes, to the end&mdash;my end and yours. O
God! Why did I not understand before?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>You must not speak like that. Love&mdash;our
love&mdash;knows no end.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Oh, I am miserable, Phillip, miserable,
miserable.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p><em>Please</em>, do not say such things.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>But I must, I must. My selfishness has
brought you to this last renouncement.
Egypt has meant so much to you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Too much, Mary, too much. Egypt was
coming between us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Your work there, the great work I have
ruined…! Egypt meant home to you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Home is where you are, dearest, and nowhere
else. You have taught me this&mdash;in
time. (<span class="direction">To himself.</span>) Egypt! Ah, Egypt!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>I hate it. It terrifies me. There is pain
for me in Egypt. An instinctive dread
comes over me always&mdash;something from very
far away. I <em>have</em> struggled against it, for
your sake, but&mdash;oh, it’s so, so strong. If
only you could forgive me&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Hush, dearest!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>But it <em>has</em> come between us. You love
it so. And it’s my fault that you can’t&mdash;your
career, I mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Dear one, whatever is, is right. There is
nothing to regret. Egypt, indeed, has drawn
me strangely. There is some power out
there&mdash;a spiritual power&mdash;that has cast a
glamour over me. It has been a passion
with me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>My instinctive terror!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>And my instinctive love!</p>

<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">They glance together in silence at a
great picture above the bed&mdash;an
Egyptian night-scene, with stars
and Nile.</span></p>

<p>Yes … yes … strange indeed! From
my earliest days it drew me. Those palms
and temples, that majestic desert&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Mrs. Lattin</span></p>

<p>Phillip, don’t! Those stars, that river
bring me sadness&mdash;immense regret. I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
them always rising over me. They watch
me!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phillip</span></p>

<p>Forgive me. It was the marvellous
beauty took me. I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

me, the chain of lives <em>must</em> bring us again

as one being. And when, in our next life,

<p>Were your thoughts so far away, Little

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lydia</span></p>

<p>I was thinking.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>And gazing across the sea as usual. What
is there so attractive beyond that dim horizon?
The future or&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Perhaps its dimness only. That’s southwards,

<p>Where have you been, Phocion? All day
I’ve missed you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>On the hills&mdash;alone. I have been thinking.</p>

<p>But you are weary, and your feet are
splashed with mud.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>I crossed the Ilissus to be sooner home,
and found it rising&mdash;in flood almost. Yesterday’s
rains on Mount Hymettus&mdash;(<span class="direction">breaks

Why, what ails you, Lydia? Do I startle
you a second time?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lydia</span></p>

<p>Forgive me, Phocion; do not notice my

<p>Phocion, let me tell you honestly&mdash;I am
afraid.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>Anxious, perhaps, but not afraid. The
mood of our beloved city takes you with it,
as it takes us all. We all are patriots to-day.
But the wife of Phocion has proved herself
no coward.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lydia</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Low voice.</span>) Alexander is so powerful.
Some say the Macedonian is a God.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>Pshaw! In his own land, perhaps. But
Athens has her own Gods. He is a conqueror,
yes; but a conqueror can only take
a city, not the souls who dwell in it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lydia</span></p>

<p>How less?</p>

<p>I suspect only. I feel you planning dangerous
things that must take you from me.
Those silent footsteps on our causeway in
the dusk, the shadows that pass between the
pillars, the rising waters&mdash;Phocion! your
strange deep love of Athens takes no account
of me, your little, suffering wife.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>The love of Athens is <em>ours</em>. It is the love
of country that the Gods call sacred. (<span class="direction">Looks

not die for you…!</p>

<p>I love <em>you</em>. If you live for me, you live

than beat as the slave of Alexander.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lydia</span></p>

<p>I love you too much to see you run on
death. Your wild plot to save our city is
but the Fates’ way of taking you away from
me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>Try, Lydia, to love me as I love Athens.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lydia</span></p>

<p>You ask too much of me. I love Hellas,
but I love you more.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Phocion</span></p>

<p>Then&mdash;not enough. (<span class="direction">Looks away.</span>) You

<p>No need now, Lucia. In Venice we are

You must have roses in your hands. I will
go to the flower-sellers by the bridge.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Paulo</span></p>

<p>And bought ten sprats instead! My wonderful,
clever house-wife. Without sprats
to eat I never could paint roses! But I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>

my love&mdash;a single moment (<span class="direction">throwing kisses

<p>Little Child! Ah, how I love that name,

<p>Patron! You must not use that word to

You must remember&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

“must” again! My gracious Lady Lucia

<p>Nothing. She remembers that her husband,

<p>The light is sweet upon your face as well.
What do you offer me in return for so great
a favour?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>I am the wife of Paulo Salviati.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>And have, as I see, married poverty as
well as genius! I was too slow for once, as
now, it seems, I am too hasty. I should
have asked&mdash;and taken&mdash;all before this fellow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Scorn.</span>) Poverty with Salviati is beauty
for <em>eternity</em>. The wealth of a Florentine
princess belongs to <em>time</em>.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>And, therefore, you come humbly to ask
<em>me</em> a favour.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>One it should be an honour for you to
grant (<span class="direction">with earnest persuasion</span>)&mdash;that you
may share in giving eternal beauty to the
world. Had I asked the Collona or the
Calviere to see the work of a great painter

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>You came, instead, to me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>You have bought the palace on the Grand
Canal and need a great&mdash;the greatest&mdash;painter
for your ceiling&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>Enthusiasm becomes you. You look divine

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Cunningly.</span>) I am his model too, you
see.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>And that delicious gesture. (<span class="direction">Steps nearer.</span>)
A little more fire, a touch more of
abandon, and I swear that&mdash;on certain conditions&mdash;oh,
very small ones!&mdash;I would
grant everything you ask.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Icily.</span>) An hour ago, when we talked
together, you passed me your word. I appealed
to you as lover of the beautiful&mdash;the
best, the noblest in you. I was, it seems,
mistaken, and our interview now had better
end. (<span class="direction">Moves to window.</span>) I will call
my husband.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>This change from fire to ice is exquisite!
(<span class="direction">Admiringly.</span>) But why so proud, fair
Lady Lucia? (<span class="direction">She stands listening.</span>) You
hear him coming? (<span class="direction">She hears the water lapping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

only the waves. The tide is rising still.
That’s all.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Distraught.</span>) Yes, rising, rising. Please
leave me, Prince. No, no&mdash;please stay&mdash;a
moment longer. (<span class="direction">Frightened.</span>) Forgive
me. Something&mdash;a vision-flashed upon me
out of darkness. I am confused. I fear.
(<span class="direction">To herself.</span>) Oh, I have done this very
thing before&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>But not with me, alas!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Goes to his side.</span>) Forgive me. I thought
only of myself. For a moment I forgot the
work, the beauty that is his divine, his holy
mission. Now I’m myself again. The water,
the rising water&mdash;somehow&mdash;in some
strange way&mdash;reminds me. Oh, I will be
wise and loving in the noblest way. (<span class="direction">Looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
into his eyes. Imploringly.</span>) It is his need,
his poverty, that drive me to ask a favour
of you who once aspired to be my lover.
Have you no pity? We fled from Florence
to escape you&mdash;it is true. I would rather
ask favours of any in the world but you&mdash;&mdash; (<span class="direction">Confused.</span>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>And yet&mdash;(<span class="direction">To himself.</span>) And you are
his model. You could live for ever on my
ceiling! (<span class="direction">To her.</span>) You are, indeed, a Goddess
belonging to eternity! (<span class="direction">Admiringly.</span>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>And yet&mdash;yes, I came to you an hour ago&mdash;as
patron. It is true. It was for his
sake and for his great art I came. (<span class="direction">Voice
singing outside.</span>) Oh, I ask no favour now
more than a little time to talk with him.
That is his voice. I will persuade him. I
will gain his consent, and he will do the picture
for you&mdash;for your palace. Leave me,
I beg, a few moments with him alone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>

<p>Oh, I implore you. Leave me with him.
(<span class="direction">Singing comes very close.</span>) I promise.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Shrugging.</span>) You have chosen the one
spell that moves me. Even more strong
than the love of a fair woman is my love
of art&mdash;its wonder, its beauty, and its triumph.
His picture will outlive even your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
loveliness. (<span class="direction">Sighs.</span>) My name and my
great palace will remind a later world of
me, and of what I did for beauty. Well,
well, my Lady Lucia, you win me over&mdash;for
the moment, at any rate. I will stand
behind this screen and listen. I must hear
how you persuade genius to abjure its principles!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

first go.</p>

spirit free, at least. The spirit of beauty
owns no master&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>The husband of such beauty should be
more gracious. (<span class="direction">Frankly.</span>) Ah, Salviati,
you speak to a Medici, indeed, but also to
one who loves beauty as you yourself do.
I might&mdash;had I persisted&mdash;have taken your
golden bird in my own net. (<span class="direction">Pauses.</span>) It
is my pleasure now to set you free from the
hard conditions that enslave you. In this
way can a Medici reward good for evil. Signor,
I forgive all for the sake of your genius.
I admire your picture&mdash;its true classic spirit.
Yet it has not quite the warmth, the fire, the
bounteous splendour we Italians ask. Give
but your sky a deeper hue, add to that robe
the undertone of scarlet it needs to make it
felt, flood our prodigal Italian sunshine over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
it all&mdash;and I will buy your picture at your
price.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes. Oh, Paulo, what an offer!
Think!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Paulo</span></p>

<p>It is not for sale.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>While you may still enter it for the Competition.
The judges&mdash;er&mdash;may hear that
Damiano di Medici has bought it for his
new Palazzo&mdash;and&mdash;judge&mdash;accordingly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Paulo</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Low.</span>) The gold, the blue, the scarlet
you desire&mdash;I mean, suggest&mdash;are not in my
scheme.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>Yet they would add the perfect touch
now lacking&mdash;in my judgment, Signor.
Come, now, I will go further. I have sworn
that my Palazzo shall surpass even that of
Cosimo, my ambitious brother, in Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
I will have a Gorgione for his Lippo Lippi,
and&mdash;if you will&mdash;a Salviati for his da
Vinci. I offer you, further, the painting of
my ceilings, Signor&mdash;seven years’ inspired
and happy labour.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Paulo</span></p>

<p>Seven years of bondage to another’s taste
and purse.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>To add this gold and blue and scarlet is&mdash;for
me&mdash;a lie.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>My offer stands&mdash;but not against unreasonable
resistance. I repeat it: this picture
at your figure, and seven years to paint the
ceilings, with a certain freedom in design
and subject, and permission to do your own
work in your leisure. It is a matter to conclude
now quickly. (<span class="direction">Ominously.</span>) It is not
amusing, though it may be novel, for a
Medici to be thwarted of his will&mdash;his deep
design. (<span class="direction">Bows.</span>)</p>

<p>A poor painter dares the novelty.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Impatient, half-threatening.</span>) Beauty
has turned your head, maybe. Excess, I
have heard it said, (<span class="direction">significantly</span>) can affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the reason. You have (<span class="direction">glancing towards
<span class="character">Lucia</span></span>) <em>too</em> much beauty. But there are
remedies&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Paulo</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Startled.</span>) I do not understand you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>As a great patron, I have my duties too.
(<span class="direction">Slowly.</span>) If the possession of too much
beauty threaten your great gift, I owe it to
the world to (<span class="direction">sinister tone and look</span>) help&mdash;to
save you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Paulo</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Facing him.</span>) I prefer plain spoken language
from a man&mdash;even though he be
patron.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>Oh, guard your tongue at least! The
Prince is patient with us.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Softly.</span>) You robbed me once of beauty
I desired. You fled from Florence. I accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with a smile, and did not bestir myself
to follow and prevent&mdash;as I could well
have done. I was too kind, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Lucia</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">Breaks in.</span>) But, great Prince, you&mdash;you
have forgotten all that. You swore&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>(<span class="direction">To her.</span>) The sight of beauty stirs my
memory again. (<span class="direction">Suggestively.</span>) For beauty
grows, it seems. (<span class="direction">Smiles admiringly.</span>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Medici</span></p>

<p>And this increase of beauty makes me
remember something I had&mdash;(<span class="direction">to <span class="character">Lucia</span></span>) as
you say&mdash;forgotten. To see him who robbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>

the light fails, will you now

<p class="speaker"><span class="character">Paulo</span></p>

<p>Never! Even in fading light I see only

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
